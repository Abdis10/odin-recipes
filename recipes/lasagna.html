        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made by layering sheets of pasta with rich meat 
            or vegetable sauce, creamy béchamel or ricotta cheese, 
            and melted mozzarella. Baked to perfection, it features a golden, 
            slightly crisp top and a hearty, flavorful interior. 
            Each bite offers a comforting combination of savory, cheesy, and tangy tomato flavors,
            making lasagna a favorite for family dinners and festive gatherings. 
            Its versatility allows for numerous variations, 
            from traditional beef to vegetarian or seafood versions, 
            catering to a wide range of tastes.</p>

            <li>Onion</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>

            <li>Canned tomato paste</li>

            <li>Mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>Eggs (optional, for ricotta mixture)</li>
            <li>Fresh or dried basil</li>
            <li>Oregano</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Black pepper</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Sugar (optional, to cut acidity in sauce)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the Meat Sauce (if using): In a large pot or Dutch oven, brown the ground meat over medium heat, breaking it up as it cooks. Drain any excess fat. Add chopped onion and cook until softened, then add minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant. Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, basil, oregano, salt, pepper, and a pinch of sugar (if desired). Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low, cover, and let it cook for at least 30 minutes, or longer for more flavor.</li>
            <li>Prepare the Ricotta Mixture: In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, about 1/2 cup of grated Parmesan cheese, an egg (if using), and a pinch of salt and pepper. Mix well until everything is thoroughly combined.</li>
            <li>Cook the Lasagna Noodles (if not using no-boil): If using regular lasagna noodles, cook them according to package directions until al dente. Drain them and rinse with cold water to prevent sticking. Lay them flat on parchment paper or a clean surface.</li>
            <li>Preheat Oven and Prepare Baking Dish: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>Assemble the Lasagna: </li>
            <ul>
                <li>Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of the prepared baking dish.</li>
                <li>Arrange a single layer of lasagna noodles over the sauce, slightly overlapping if necessary.</li>
                <li>Evenly spread half of the ricotta mixture over the noodles.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle a generous layer of shredded mozzarella cheese over the ricotta.</li>
                <li>Add another layer of meat sauce.</li>
                <li>Repeat the noodle, ricotta, mozzarella, and meat sauce layers.</li>
                <li>For the final layer, place noodles, cover with the remaining meat sauce, and top with a generous amount of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Bake the Lasagna: Cover the baking dish loosely with aluminum foil (you might want to spray the underside of the foil with cooking spray to prevent cheese from sticking). Bake for 25-30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Brown the Cheese: Remove the foil and bake for another 15-20 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.</li>
            <li>Rest and Serve: Let the lasagna rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing and serving. This allows it to set and makes for cleaner slices.</li>
        </ol>
